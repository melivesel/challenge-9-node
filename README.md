## Description
This program uses the node extension inquirer to take user input and use it to create a README file. It automatically formats the page in markdown so the user does not have to remember where to put hashtags! Every project needs a README so anything to make it easy to generate is a benefit to society. 

## Usage
Input your information to automatically generate a professional and intuitive README page. It automatically generates a table of contents for simple navigation. You have three choices of license, whichever you choose will appear as a badge at the top of the page. When you add your contact info, it formats as a clickable link for ease of use.
